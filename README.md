# SASS for Bones

My preferred scss folder for wordPress development with Bones.
This is designed to work in conjunction with [Grunt for Bones](https://github.com/luetkemj/grunt-for-bones/)

## Get Started
1. Head over to [Grunt for Bones](https://github.com/luetkemj/grunt-for-bones/) and get started over there.
2. Replace the SCSS folder in bones with this one.
3. make happy!


### Planned
* something magical; I can feel it
